LabInform documentation
=======================

Welcome! This is the documentation for LabInform. For general information see its `Homepage <https://www.labinform.de/>`_.

LabInform is a framework and toolchain for **reproducible research**, focussing on free and open-source software components. Integral parts are an **electronic lab notebook** (ELN) based on `DokuWiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/>`_, a **datasafe** as central storage for all your valuable data, and **unique identifiers** (*Lab Object Identifier*, LOI, much like the well-known DOIs) for datasets, samples, and alike.

Together with ASpecD (*Analysis of Spectral Data*, `Homepage <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_), a framework for handling spectroscopic data focussing on reproducibility, it forms the basis of fully reproducible research without additional costs.

.. warning::
  LabInform is currently under active development and still considered in Alpha development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.

A note on the logo
------------------

The "L" originates from the Computer Modern Roman font originally designed by Donald E. Knuth for his TeX typesetting system. As such, it represents science and the scientific method. Harbouring the "i" representing the information bit puts things right: Proper and reproducible science is the solid support for all the information we can retrieve. The copyright of the logo belongs to J. Popp.
