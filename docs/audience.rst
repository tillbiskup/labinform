Who is the target audience of the LabInform framework? Is it interesting for me?


Scientists aiming at reproducibility
====================================

The LabInform framework addresses every scientist working with data (both, measured and calculated) on a daily base. As LabInform is developed by an (experimental) spectroscopist, the focus is mainly on spectroscopy for the time being, although the underlying concepts should be sufficiently general to be useful in other context as well.


Motivation and general ideas
============================

The motivation and general idea behind the LabInform framework is to ensure reproducibility and---as much as possible---replicability of the entire research process, starting from planning experiments and ending with final (peer-reviewed) publication of the results.

Every scientist should be well familiar with the concept of reproducibility and its importance for science in general. If you don't really care about reproducibility, you will probably have hard time using the LabInform framework. Particularly those aspects of the framework ensuring reproducibility may impair your personal freedom of doing things your way. If, however, you do care about reproducibility and are looking for a system that helps you to achieve this goal, LabInform may well be interesting for you.


Relation to the ASpecD framework
================================

Whereas the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_ focusses on reproducible handling of spectroscopic data, LabInform provides the larger infrastructure to achieve truly reproducible science on a larger scale.
