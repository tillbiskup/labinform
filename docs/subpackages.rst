Subpackages
===========

Only parts of the LabInform infrastructure are own developments written in Python. Other components are based on well-established and robust free and open-source components, such as `DokuWiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/>`_ as basis of an electronic lab notebook (and much more).

The subpackages shortly described in the following are part of the LabInform Python package.

Lab Object Identifiers (LOI)

Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)
=============================

The actual ELN is usually implemented using a `DokuWiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/>`_ instance. However, it is often useful to interact directly from within programs, such as routines of the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_.
