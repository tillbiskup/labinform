LabInform
=========

LabInform is a framework and toolchain for **reproducible research**, focussing on free and open-source software components. Integral parts are an **electronic lab notebook** (ELN) based on `DokuWiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/>`_, a **datasafe** as central storage for all your valuable data, and **unique identifiers** (*Lab Object Identifier*, LOI, much like the well-known DOIs) for datasets, samples, and alike.

Together with `ASpecD <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_ (*Analysis of Spectral Data*), a framework for handling spectroscopic data focussing on reproducibility, it forms the basis of fully reproducible research without additional costs.

For more general information on LabInform see its `homepage <https://www.labinform.de/>`_.
